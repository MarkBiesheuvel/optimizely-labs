# `[FX4]` Create your second feature experiment and make it exclusive

In this hands-on lab, you will create a second experiment and make sure visitors are included in either your first or second experiment, but never both at the same time.

## Prerequisites

You already completed [`[FX3]`](../fx3/).
Your current Optimizely plan has Exclusion Groups enabled (i.e. the Scale package).

## Introduction

Our first experiment is doing well and is collecting data. While we wait for it to reach statistical significance, we are going to build our second experiment. However, the only challange is that these two experiments do not work together. We want a visitor to be either in experiment 1 or in experiment 2, but never both. Let's create an exclusion group!

## Instructions
