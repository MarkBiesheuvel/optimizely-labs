# Hands-on labs for Optimizely Web/Feature Experimentation

This is a collections of hands-on labs for a custom training programma from Expert Services.

The training porgramming starts with a combined introductions for both Web Experimentation and Feature experimentation. This first session does not have a hands-on lab. After the introduction sessions there are separate tracks for either Web or Feature Experimentation, denoted by the `[WX_]` or `[FX_]` tag respectively. 

## Acknowledgements

The hands-on labs use code snippets that are built using JavaScript and React. This language and framework are chosen because they are easy to run in your browser without needing to install a development environment. While your organization might not use React, the hands-on labs are still helpful in teaching you all about Optimizely. Since the SDKs for different languages.

Note that while the labs use React for rendering elements, it does not use the Optimizely React SDK. Instead it uses the Optimizely JavaScript SDK since it can easily be included with a single script tag. If you are building a React application, consider installing the Optimizely React SDK and bundling it with your app.

These labs are simplified examples. Do as they say, not as they do.
