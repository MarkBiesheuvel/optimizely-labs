# Instructions on how to set up a project for hands-on labs

For the best experience, it is recommended to create separate project(s) for the hands-on labs.
Go to "Account Settings" > "Projects" and create one Full Stack project for called "Hands-on labs - Feature Experimentation" and one Web project called "Hands-on labs - Web Experimentation".
Go to "Account Settings" > "Projects" and create a user account for every participant of the training programme and give them the "Publisher" role in both projects.
